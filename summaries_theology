1. I'm to write my thoughts on theology. I believe 99% of theses are not new, but I don't have time to examine them carefully. An idea may have different outlooking so hard to goole for comparision. So I just wrote them down for a later research. These thoughts are mainly out of my own purpose of satisfactory, so it's not coherent in nature.Whereas I see a likely application of these thoughts that may help believers

2. True or false is a state of mind of juvenille. upon all arguments excepte beliefs in Jesus, we regard neither fullly true nor fully false. Logically , if we regard something as true, it should be compatible with beliefs in Jesus; that's usually not guaranteed. We believe anything to some extend that not beyond it's margin, this is called positivism. That's to say, communism is partly true, athesm is partly true, 

3. To very extension we believe in Bible, because that's where we knew Jesus. and hence forth comes beliefs in Jesus.
